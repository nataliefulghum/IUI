I tripped on my shoelace<br>
and I fell Up-<br>
Up to the roof tops<br>
Up over the town<br>
Up past the tree tops,<br>
Up over the mountains<br>
Up where the colors<br>
Blend into the sounds<br>
But it got me so dizzy<br>
When I looked around<br>
I got sick to my stomach<br>
And I threw down.
