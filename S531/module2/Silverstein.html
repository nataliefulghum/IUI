<h1>Falling Down</h1> 
<h2>Shel Silverstein (1996)</h2>


<p style="color:#FF8333;">
I tripped on my shoelace<br>
And I fell up-<br>
Up to the roof tops,<br>
Up over the town,
Up past the tree tops,<br>
Up over the mountains,<br>
Up where the colors<br>
Blend into the sounds
But it got me so dizzy<br>
When I looked around,<br>
I got sick to my stomach<br>
And I threw down.
</p>
